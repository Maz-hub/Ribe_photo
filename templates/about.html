          Photography has been a constant in my life for as long as I can
          remember. Even as a child, I felt an urge to hold onto moments—to
          freeze time, if only for an instant. There’s something extraordinary
          about capturing what feels fleeting, something that might otherwise
          slip away unnoticed.

          When I first picked up a camera as a teenager, it wasn’t just about
          taking pictures. It was about seeing. I realized photography isn’t
          just a tool to reproduce reality; it’s a way to interpret it, to
          reveal layers that are often overlooked.

          For me, this journey began in Piedmont, the place I call home, with
          its rolling hills and quiet beauty. It’s where I first learned to
          chase the light, to wait patiently for that perfect moment when
          everything aligns. And now, in the Riviera Vaudoise of Switzerland,
          surrounded by towering peaks and reflective waters, I find myself
          rediscovering that same awe. These landscapes, so different yet so
          familiar, remind me that there’s always something new to see if you’re
          paying attention.

          Photography, for me, is more than an art form—it’s a way of life. It’s
          about slowing down, observing the small details, and finding beauty in
          the unexpected. It’s about the way a shadow moves across a mountain,
          the fleeting glow of a sunset, or the stillness of a misty morning.
          These are the moments that keep me searching, keep me inspired.
        </p>

          The galleries you’ll find here are pieces of that journey—snapshots of
          time and place, glimpses into the world as I see it. They’re a
          reflection of the way photography shapes how I connect with the world
          around me. And they’re ever-evolving, just like the landscapes and
          stories they capture.
